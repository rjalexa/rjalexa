- 👋 Hi, I’m @rjalexa, a medical doctor dabbling with a little information technology (and service design and medical research)
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming fluent with python and data science and AI technologies
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the above trying to devise little "experiments" with real data rather than working on abstract cases.
- 💞️ I’m looking for python/data science/AI mentors and can reciprocate with some medical/biological mentorship.
- 📫 my email is bob and can be reached at my ralexander.it domain. Live on Central European time. Keep safe!
