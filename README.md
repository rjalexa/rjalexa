- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rjalexa, a medical doctor dabbling with  information technology (and service design and medical research)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m striving to becoming fluent with data science and knowledge modeling.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently practicing the above trying to devise little "experiments" with real data rather than working on abstract cases.
- ðŸ“« my email is bob and can be reached at my ralexander.it domain. I live on Central European time. Keep safe!
